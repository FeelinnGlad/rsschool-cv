### Summary
Upon the completion of courses I plan getting a BSc at inf systems engineering. I’m looking for a job in UI design or anything related to that. Personally I’ve decided to choose the IT sphere due to its really high demand nowadays and of course because of truly wide range of occupations it can offer. And by extension I’m really keen on developing my knowledge in this sphere.

While speaking of personal traits, can say I am very attentive to details and quality-oriented. Thus in work I mostly use creative way of thinking, whether it’s coding or design activity. I used to be not a very persuasive and out-going person, but I’m working on it and learning to perform in small groups quite well.

Would also add that I possess good communication skills in English both verbally and in writing, accuracy and patience on work.
